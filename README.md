The ***NetPractice*** project is a network fundamentals assignment at 42 designed to introduce key concepts in computer networking, such as **IP addressing**, **subnetting**, **routing**, and **network design**. The goal was to solve a series of interactive network configuration challenges by correctly assigning IPs, masks, and gateways to ensure proper connectivity between different nodes.
This project focuses on logic, precision, and understanding how devices communicate over a network â€” without writing code, but by solving real-world networking scenarios.

What I had to do:
* Understand and apply **IPv4** addressing and subnetting principles
* Configure networks with correct **IP addresses**, **subnet masks**, and **default gateways**
* Analyze and design routing paths between multiple network segments
* Solve increasingly complex exercises using a visual interface provided by 42
* Ensure all devices in a network could communicate as intended, including across routers and subnets
* Debug misconfigured topologies and fix broken network routes
  
To achieve this, I had to:
* Calculate network and broadcast addresses
* Determine usable IP ranges within subnets
* Assign IPs in a way that avoided conflicts and respected routing rules
* Understand how routers forward packets and what makes a connection fail
* Think logically through each setup, from simple peer-to-peer networks to multi-router topologies

What I Learned:
* Deep understanding of IPv4 addressing, CIDR notation, and subnetting
* How data is routed between networks using gateways and routing tables
* How devices determine whether a destination is local or remote
* Real-world troubleshooting techniques for broken or misconfigured networks
* Precision and attention to detail when designing or analyzing a network topology

NetPractice gave me a solid foundation in how networks operate and communicate. It taught me how to approach connectivity problems methodically, a mindset that's crucial for systems programming, infrastructure management, and cybersecurity.
